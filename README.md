# Improving safety at large public events

## Project Drishti – Hackathon Submission
🏆 Project Drishti – AI-Powered Event Safety Platform
🎯 Objective:
Project Drishti is an intelligent situational awareness platform designed to act as the central nervous system for managing public event safety. By integrating cutting-edge Google AI technologies, it enables real-time monitoring, predictive analysis, and automated emergency response at large-scale events like music festivals or rallies.
🚀 Key Features:
1. **Predictive Bottleneck Analysis**:
- Ingests real-time video feeds via Vertex AI Vision.
- Analyzes crowd density, velocity, and flow.
- Forecasts congestion points 15–20 minutes in advance using Vertex AI Forecasting.
2. **AI-Powered Situational Summaries**:
- Commanders query in natural language (e.g., “Summarize West Zone threats”).
- Gemini Pro fuses video alerts, reports, and social media into actionable briefings.
3. **Intelligent Resource Dispatch**:
- Detects incidents from feeds or mobile app.
- Uses GPS + Google Maps API to route nearest responders via least congested path.
4. **Multimodal Anomaly Detection**:
- Gemini Pro identifies visual signatures of panic, fire, or smoke from live feeds.
- Triggers real-time, high-priority alerts.
5. **Go Beyond Innovations**:
- AI Lost & Found: Image-based person detection across feeds.
- Crowd Sentiment Analysis: Detects mood shifts indicating unrest.
- Autonomous Drone Dispatch for close-up incident inspection.
🧠 Tech Stack:
- **Firebase**: Auth, Firestore, Cloud Functions, Hosting, Realtime DB
- **Vertex AI & Gemini**: Computer vision, forecasting, NLP, anomaly detection
- **Google Maps Platform**: Live routing, geolocation, Places API
- **GCP**: Compute Engine, Cloud CDN, Cloud Storage
💡 What Makes It Unique:
- Unified multi-modal AI platform for proactive public safety
- Anonymous detection for privacy-first compliance (GDPR-ready)
- Scalable serverless infrastructure
- React Native + Web support for universal access
🏅 Competitive Edge:
- Only solution combining safety, prediction, and dispatch in one
- Uses enterprise-grade AI with proven Google ecosystem integration
- Real-time volunteer response network & cross-platform availability
Deployed with Firebase Studio for real-time monitoring and scalability. Project Drishti is not just reactive—it’s the future of proactive, intelligent crowd safety.
